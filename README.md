## Description
Using node.js, the inquirer package and es6, we had to create an application that would easily generate a unique README file with the users input, guided by prompts. This was made to make the sometimes tedious process of creating a README, easy. In the process I learnt about node.js, arrow functions, licence badges and es6.
